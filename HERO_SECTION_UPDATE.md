# Hero Section Update

## ✅ What Was Changed

Updated the hero section copy to be more direct and problem-focused.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Headline - Simplified
**Before:**
```
Instant Hiring Reality Check.
Before You Waste 2 Months.
(And Your Hiring Budget)
```

**After:**
```
Instant Hiring Reality Check
```

**Why:** Cleaner, more direct, less cluttered

---

### 2. Body Copy - Problem-Focused
**Before:**
```
Enter a job role or paste a job description URL. We'll tell you exactly why
nobody's applying, or if you're actually offering market rate for a unicorn engineer.
```

**After:**
```
Most roles fail before they even hit the market.
Wrong scope. Wrong salary. Wrong expectations.
Teams only find out 60–90 days later.

Paste a job URL or add a few details — HireCards shows if the role is hireable, 
what's off, how to fix it, and gives you a full hiring strategy in under 5 minutes.
```

**Why:** 
- Highlights the pain point first
- More specific about the problem (60-90 days)
- Clear value proposition
- Emphasizes speed (under 5 minutes)

---

### 3. CTA Button - More Direct
**Before:**
```
Reality Check
```

**After:**
```
Run My Reality Check
```

**Why:** 
- More personal ("My")
- Action-oriented ("Run")
- Clearer call-to-action

---

## 💡 Copywriting Principles Applied

### 1. Problem-First
✅ Start with the pain ("Most roles fail")
✅ Make it specific ("60-90 days later")
✅ Create urgency

### 2. Clear Value Proposition
✅ What you get ("full hiring strategy")
✅ How fast ("under 5 minutes")
✅ What it solves ("what's off, how to fix it")

### 3. Direct Language
✅ Short sentences
✅ Active voice ("Run My Reality Check")
✅ No fluff

### 4. Social Proof (Implied)
✅ "Teams only find out..." (others have this problem)
✅ "Most roles fail..." (universal problem)

---

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Spacing
- Added more breathing room between headline and body
- Better line breaks for readability
- Cleaner hierarchy

### Typography
- `mb-6` for headline (more space)
